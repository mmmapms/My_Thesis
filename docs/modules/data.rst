This subpackage provides an interface to extract data from different day-ahead electricity markets and a module to process the market data before its use in prediction models. 

The first functionality is provided by the :ref:`data extraction <dataexct>` module,  which provides automatic access to the data from five different day-ahead electricity markets as well as an easy-to-use interface to read data from other markets.

The second functionality is provided by the :ref:`data wrangling <datawrang>` module, which includes the most common scaling transformations in electricity price forecasting.
