Giacomini-White test
=====================
This module provides a function :py:class:`GW <epftoolbox.evaluation.GW>` that implements the one-sided version of the Giacomini-White (GW) test for Conditional Predictive Ability (CPA) in the context of electricity price forecasting. 

Additionally, the module provides a function :py:class:`plot_multivariate_GW_test <epftoolbox.evaluation.plot_multivariate_GW_test>` that plots the results of pairwise comparisonsi between multiple models.

GW test
--------

The Giacomini-White (GW) test can be seen as a generalization of the :ref:`Diebold-Mariano test` that measures the CPA instead of the Unconditional Predictive Ability. The test, like the :ref:`DM variant <Diebold-Mariano test>`, measures the statistical significance of the differences of two models forecasts. It is an asymptotic :math:`\chi^2`-test of the null hypothesis :math:`\mathrm{H}_0:\phi=0` in the regression: 

.. math::
   \begin{equation}
   \Delta^{\mathrm{A, B}}_d = \phi'\mathbb{X}_{d-1} + \varepsilon_d,
   \end{equation}

where :math:`\mathbb{X}_{d-1}` contains elements from the information set on day :math:`d-1`, i.e., a constant and lags of :math:`\Delta^{\mathrm{A, B}}_d`. The loss differential is obtained like in the DM test:

.. math::

	\begin{equation}
	\Delta^{\mathrm{A, B}}_{k} = L(\varepsilon^\mathrm{A}_{k}) - L(\varepsilon^\mathrm{B}_{k})
	\end{equation}

where :math:`\varepsilon^\mathrm{Z}_{k}=p_{k}-\hat{p}_{k}` is the prediction error of model Z for time step
:math:`k` and :math:`L(\cdot)` is the loss function. For point forecasts, we usually take :math:`L(\varepsilon^\mathrm{Z}_{k})=|\varepsilon^\mathrm{Z}_{k}|^p` with :math:`p=1` or :math:`2`, which corresponds to the absolute and squared losses.

This module implements the one-sided version of the GW test using the a function :py:class:`GW <epftoolbox.evaluation.GW>` function. Given the forecast of a model A and the forecast of a model B, the test evaluates the null hypothesis :math:`H_0` of the CPA of the loss differential of model A being higher or equal than that of model B. Hence, rejecting the null :math:`H_0` means that the forecasts of model B are significantly more accurate than those of model A. 

The module provides the two standard versions of the test in electricity price forecasting: an univariate and a multivariate version. The univariate version of the test has the advantage of providing a deeper analysis as it indicates which forecast is significantly better for which hour of the days. The multivariate version grants a better representation of the results as it summarizes the comparison in a single p-value.

plot_multivariate_GW_test
------------------------------------------------------

The :py:class:`plot_multivariate_GW_test <epftoolbox.evaluation.plot_multivariate_GW_test>` provides an easy-to-use interface to plot in a heat map with a chessboard shape the results of using the DM test to compare the forecasts of multiple models. An example of the heat map is provided below in the function example.
