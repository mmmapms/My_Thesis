=====================
Diebold-Mariano test
=====================
This module provides a function :py:class:`DM <epftoolbox.evaluation.DM
>` that implements the one-sided version of the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test in the context of electricity price forecasting. 

Besides the DM test, the module also provides a function :py:class:`plot_multivariate_DM_test <epftoolbox.evaluation.plot_multivariate_DM_test>` to plot the DM results when comparing multiple forecasts.

DM test
--------

The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test is probably the most commonly used tool to evaluate the significance of differences in forecasting accuracy. It is an asymptotic z-test of the hypothesis that the mean of the loss differential series: 

.. math::

	\begin{equation}
	\Delta^{\mathrm{A, B}}_{k} = L(\varepsilon^\mathrm{A}_{k}) - L(\varepsilon^\mathrm{B}_{k})
	\end{equation}

where :math:`\varepsilon^\mathrm{Z}_{k}=p_{k}-\hat{p}_{k}` is the prediction error of model Z for time step
:math:`k` and :math:`L(\cdot)` is the loss function. For point forecasts, we usually take :math:`L(\varepsilon^\mathrm{Z}_{k})=|\varepsilon^\mathrm{Z}_{k}|^p` with :math:`p=1` or :math:`2`, which corresponds to the absolute and squared losses.

This module implements the one-sided version of the DM test using the a function :py:class:`DM <epftoolbox.evaluation.DM
>` function. Given the forecast of a model A and the forecast of a model B, the test evaluates the null hypothesis :math:`H_0` of the mean of the loss differential of model A being lower or equal than that of model B. Hence, rejecting the null :math:`H_0` means that the forecasts of model B are significantly more accurate than those of model A. 

The module provides the two standard versions of the test in electricity price forecasting: an univariate and a multivariate version. The univariate version of the test has the advantage of providing a deeper analysis as 
it indicates which forecast is significantly better for which hour of the days. The multivariate version 
grants a better representation of the results as it summarizes the comparison in a single p-value.

------------------------------------------------------

The :py:class:`plot_multivariate_DM_test <epftoolbox.evaluation.plot_multivariate_DM_test>` provides an easy-to-use interface to plot in a heat map with a chessboard shape the results of using the DM test to compare the forecasts of multiple models. An example of the heat map is provided below in the function example.
