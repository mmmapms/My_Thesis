Forecasting models
==================

This subpackage provides an easy interface to two state-of-the-art forecasting models in the field of
electricity price forecasting:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   The LEAR model<lear_model>
   The DNN model<dnn_model>
   

For the :ref:`LEAR` model, the subpackage provides an interface to perform estimation, daily recalibration,
and prediction. For :ref:`DNN` model, it provides an interface to perform estimation,
hyperparameter optimization, daily recalibration, and prediction.  

A more detailed explanations of the models can be obtained in:
