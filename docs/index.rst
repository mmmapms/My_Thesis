Welcome to epftoolbox's documentation!
======================================

This is the documentation of the epftoolbox, the first open-access library for driving research in electricity price forecasting. Its main goal is to make available a set of tools that ensure reproducibility and establish research standards in electricity price forecasting research.


The library contrain three main components: 

* The :ref:`data management<dataman>` subpackage, which comprises a module for :ref:`processing data<datawrang>` and another module for :ref:`dataset extraction<dataexct>`.

* The :ref:`models<models>` subpackage, which provides two state of the art forecasting models for electricity price forecasting. The contains a module for the :ref:`learref` model and another module for the :ref:`dnnref` model.

* The :ref:`evaluation<eval>` subpackage, which includes a module for evaluating the performance of the models in terms of :ref:`accuracy metrics<metrics>`, and another module to compare the forecasts of the models via :ref:`statistical testing<statest>`.

The library is distributed under the `AGPL-3.0 License <https://github.com/jeslago/epftoolbox/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_ and it is built on top of scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, hyperopt, statsmodels, numpy, and pandas.
